# Type Error in TypeScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript functions and how to solve it.

## The Bug

The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers as input and return their sum. However, the code attempts to call it with a string ('10') instead of a number. This results in a TypeScript type error.
